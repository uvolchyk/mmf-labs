# 101, Stranger! üëã
---
Whether you came here with a clear purpose or got randomly <br>
I usually place here ready solutions of laboratory works <br>
with the reason to help other students reduce the time <br>
they usually spend on resolving tasks <br>

Unfortunately, I can't bet that anything <br>
you can find here is properly done. <br>
Anyway, if you have any troubles, <br>
try to resolve them alone. In a pinch - text me <br>
I will find a little time to help you <br>

wish you luck ‚ù§Ô∏è

MMF, 9 group (18-22 yy)
