# 101, Stranger! 👋

Regardless of whether you came here intentionally or got accidentally, <br>
Please, read this message, thx 🙂 <br>

I usually do place here finished works of various subjects <br>
by the only reason: to help other students reduce the time <br>
they need to spend on solving their tasks. <br>

But, unfortunately, I can't assure that all the solutions you see here are completely correct. <br>
For this reason, I kindly ask you to do some mind work from your side, when necessary. <br>
As a last resort, you can knock on my mail, I'll try to find a little time to help you. 😉 <br>

Wish you luck ❤️

MMF, 9 group (18-22 yy)
